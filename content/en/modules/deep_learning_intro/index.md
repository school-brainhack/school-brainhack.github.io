## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 3h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [installation](/modules/installation) module.
 * the [python data analysis](/modules/python_data_analysis) module (recommended for Python familiarity).

Contact Desiree Lussier if you have questions on this module, or if you want to check that you completed successfully all the exercises.

## Resources
The first portion of this module was presented by Blake Richards during Brainhack School 2020

## Exercise

 * Watch the video presentation by Blake Richards.
 * Consider these statements/questions and answer them briefly in a saved doc:
 * * Give an example of a research question that you could use deep learning to solve.
 * * How would deep learning provide an advantage for solving the problem?
 * * Give an example of a research question for which deep learning would not be appropriate.
 * * What would be a disadvantage of deep learning compared to another method?
 * Follow up with Désirée Lussier to validate you completed the exercise correctly.
 * 🎉 🎉 🎉 you completed this training module! 🎉 🎉 🎉

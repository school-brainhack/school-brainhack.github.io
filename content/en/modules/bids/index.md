## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 2h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [installation](/modules/installation) module.
 * the [introduction to the terminal](/modules/terminal) module.
 * the [python for data analysis](/modules/python_data_analysis) module.

If you have any questions regarding the module content please ask them in the relevant module channel on the school Discord server. If you do not have access to the server and would like to join, please send us an email at school [dot] brainhack [at] gmail [dot] com.

## Resources

This module was originally presented by [Christopher J. Markiewicz](https://effigies.github.io/) during the QLSC 612 course in 2020.

An updated version of the slides by [Hao-Ting Wang](https://wanghaoting.com/) is [here](https://wanghaoting.com/bids-ecosystem) and presented at Brainhack School Montreal 2025.

The video of the previous version of the presentation by [Christopher J. Markiewicz](https://effigies.github.io/)  is available below:

## Exercise
 * Download a few subjects (n=3) from the dataset [DS000228](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000228/versions/1.1.0) on openneuro. Hint: the dataset is available with datalad from this [git](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000228) repository.
 * Check that the resulting folder is a bids-compliant dataset using the bids validator (using a web browser or a local `npm` install). Did you get any warnings? Explain what they are and whether they are a concern.
 * Install pybids. Use pybids to get a list of all BOLD `nii.gz` files for subject `pixar003`. In which folder did you find them? is it logical? You may want to have a look at the [BIDS documentation](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) to familiarize yourself with the BIDS standard.
 * Using pybids, get a list of the flip angles in `DS000228`.
 * Clone a Midnight Brain Scan dataset from this [git](https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds000224) repository. Use `pybids` to load the `participant.tsv` file as a pandas dataframe in python.
 
 * Follow up with your local TA(s) to validate you completed the exercises correctly.
 * :tada: :tada: :tada: you completed this training module! :tada: :tada: :tada:

## Information

The estimated time to complete this training module is 2h.

The prerequisites to take this module are:
 * the [Using git and github](/modules/git_github) module.

It is highly recommended to also have done the [python script](/modules/python_scripts) module and the [packaging](/modules/packaging) module, but that's not strictly necessary for completing the exercise.

summary: "This project applies a contrastive variational autoencoder (CVAE) to Burner-preprocessed MRI data from the ADHD-200 dataset to disentangle ADHD-specific brain features from shared anatomical variation. We explore latent representations using RSA and clustering to better understand neuroanatomical heterogeneity in ADHD."

## Project definition

### Background

- Reconstruct 3D brain MRIs using CVAEs.
- Disentangle "salient" ADHD-related features from "background" features common to both ADHD and typically developing children.
- Assess how well the learned latent spaces reflect behavioral and clinical variation using:
  - **Silhouette Analysis**
  - **Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)**

### Tools

This project used:
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Keras (TensorFlow backend) for deep learning
- UMAP for latent space visualization
- Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) using Kendall’s tau
- Silhouette analysis for latent space separability
- GitHub for version control

### Data

This project used the publicly available [ADHD-200 dataset](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/), specifically the **Burner-preprocessed version**:
- Structural MRI data processed via voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
- Normalized 3D gray matter volumes (64×64×64)
- Accompanied by phenotypic variables: age, sex, diagnosis, subtype, medication, IQ, etc.

### Deliverables

At the end of the project, we produced:
- A working CVAE framework for modeling neuroanatomical variation
- Visualizations of latent features and synthetic brain reconstructions
- RSA and clustering results relating brain features to clinical data
- Well-documented code and reproducible analysis notebooks

## Results

### Progress overview

We trained a CVAE model with two latent components:
- `s` (salient features): ADHD-specific anatomical variation
- `z` (background features): common/shared variation

We evaluated the model using:
- **Silhouette scores** for latent clustering
- **RSA** to correlate latent dimensions with phenotypic variables
- **GMM clustering and BIC** to test for discrete vs. continuous subtype structure

### Tools I learned during this project

- Contrastive representation learning in generative models
- Implementation of CVAEs in Keras
- Preprocessing and working with VBM MRI data
- Representational Similarity Analysis
- Model interpretability techniques for brain data

### Results

#### Deliverable 1: CVAE analysis

- Salient features (`s`) were significantly correlated with:
  - **ADHD Index**
  - **Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive scores**
  - **Medication status** and **age**

- Shared features (`z`) were more related to:
  - **IQ**, **gender**, and **scan site**

#### Deliverable 2: Clustering analysis

- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) showed:
  - **Lowest BIC at 1 cluster**, suggesting **continuous heterogeneity**
  - Results align with dimensional models of psychiatric disorders

#### Deliverable 3: Code and notebook

- Full training pipeline in `Train-CVAE-ADHD200.ipynb`
- Visualization and RSA in helper scripts
- Readme documentation and reproducibility checklist included

## Conclusion and acknowledgement

This project demonstrates the potential of contrastive deep generative models like CVAEs to disentangle disorder-specific neuroanatomical features from shared variation. Our findings suggest ADHD may be better described along a spectrum rather than discrete subtypes. We thank the Brainhack School instructors and the open neuroimaging community for providing tools and data that made this project possible.

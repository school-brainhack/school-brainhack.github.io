## Project definition

### Background

Inferencing is a fundamental process through which the human brain updates its beliefs about environmental causes and future states. This belief-updating can occur via passive inference, where prior beliefs and outcomes are only loosely connected, and new beliefs primarily emerge from observing associations in the environment.
However, inference is not always passive. It can also take an active form, involving hypothesis-driven actions that manipulate contextual elements and actively test the causal links between beliefs and outcomes.
To explore this distinction, our study aims to examine how the brain supports these two types of inference—active and passive—during the process of posterior belief integration. To this end, our lab designed the Visual Rule Inference Task (VRIT), a paradigm specifically developed to probe the neural mechanisms involved in these distinct inferential processes.
The goal of this project is to uncover the inference processes that underlie participants’ behavior as they perform the VRIT. To do so, I analyzed both neural and behavioral data, with a particular focus on how participants engage in inference under different task conditions—namely, active versus passive inference. More specifically, I applied trial-by-trial analysis to track participants’ learning trajectories over time.

### Tools

The project will rely on the following technologies:
 * Python, to organize data, analyze and visualize behavior and brain data.
 * SPM, to analyze brain data.
 * Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests.

### Data

The dataset I used in this project is from Brain and Mind Lab, Taiwan. https://gibms.mc.ntu.edu.tw/bmlab/


### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we will have:
 - The current markdown document, completed and revised.
 - A gallery of the student projects at Brainhack 2025.
 - Instructions on the website about how to submit a pull request to the [brainhack school website](https://github.com/PSY6983-2021) in order to add the project description to the website.
 - "As the study is still unpublished, this repository contains only the Python scripts I wrote and shared as part of my learning experience during the Brainhack School."

## Results

### Progress overview

The project was swiftly initiated by P Bellec, based on the existing template created in 2019 by Tristan Glatard and improved by different students. It was really not that hard. Community feedback is expected to lead to rapid further improvements of this first version.

### Tools I learned during this project
 * Python, to organize data, analyze and visualize behavior and brain data.
 * SPM, to analyze brain data.
 * Adding the project to the website relies on github, through pull requests.

### Results

#### Deliverable 1: report template

You are currently reading the report template! I will let you judge whether it is useful or not. If you think there is something that could be improved, please do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/PSY6983-2021/project_template/issues/) and let us know.

#### Deliverable 2: project gallery

You can check out the [2020 BrainHack School project gallery](https://psy6983.brainhackmtl.org/project/)

##### ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.

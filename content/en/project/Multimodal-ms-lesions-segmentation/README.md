## Project definition

### Background

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system, with spinal cord involvement playing a critical role in clinical outcomes. Although MRI is essential for MS diagnosis and disease monitoring [1], spinal cord imaging remains challenging due to anatomical complexity and variability in acquisition protocols. Existing automated lesion segmentation tools have focused primarily on the brain [2–4], and very few methods were designed for spinal cord lesions, particularly across heterogeneous and multimodal MRI data. Additionally, high inter- and intra-rater variability in manual annotations [5] highlights the need for reliable, automated segmentation pipelines.

In this study, we introduce a novel pipeline for the automatic segmentation of MS lesions in the spinal cord using multiple MRI acquisitions from the same patient. Our approach combines a deep learning model with a robust post-processing framework to produce accurate lesion instance segmentations and estimate prediction uncertainty, addressing the specific challenges of spinal cord imaging.

### Objectives

In this project, I focus on the [Multiple Sclerosis Spinal Cord Lesions Detection from MultiSequence MRIs Challenge (MS-Multi-Spine)](https://zenodo.org/records/14051168) and develop a model capable of multimodal MS lesion segmentation.

- Train a multimodal nnUNet [6] on the challenge’s dataset (private)  
- Make the model and pipeline open-source on GitHub (public)  
- Containerize the pipeline and provide a Boutiques descriptor to facilitate reuse (public)  

### Tools

This project uses the following tools:

- **Terminal**: all code is designed to run in the terminal  
- **Python**: all scripts are written in Python  
- **Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)** [7]: used for preprocessing steps such as coregistration  
- **Git and GitHub**: for version control and open access  
- **Docker**: to ensure reproducibility  
- **Boutiques**: to automate and simplify tool usage  

### Data

The dataset used in this project is provided by the challenge and is private. It includes:

- 100 subjects in total  
- 50 subjects with T2w + STIR acquisitions  
- 25 subjects with T2w + PSIR acquisitions  
- 25 subjects with T2w + MP2RAGE acquisitions  

### Deliverables in Week 4

- A GitHub repository containing Python scripts for data preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing  
- A Dockerfile used to create the Docker image available [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tomdag25/ms-seg-challenge2025-multimodal/general)  
- A Boutiques descriptor to perform inference  

### Results

Over the four weeks, I developed a pipeline for the automatic segmentation of MS lesions in a multimodal context. I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Python scripting**: all processing steps are implemented in Python  
- **Git and GitHub**: all project code and resources are versioned and publicly available  
- **Spinal Cord Toolbox**: used for preprocessing (e.g., coregistration)  
- **Docker**: used to package the pipeline and publish the image to Docker Hub  
- **Boutiques**: used to create a descriptor for automated execution of the tool  

### Deliverable 1: GitHub Repository

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the training, inference, and submission process. Instructions to train and perform inference are available [here](multimodal-model/training-and-inference-script).

### Deliverable 2: Docker

The repository includes the Dockerfile used to build the image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tomdag25/ms-seg-challenge2025-multimodal/general). Instructions for building the image locally are provided [here](multimodal-model/docker).

### Deliverable 3: Boutiques Descriptor

The Boutiques descriptor is available [here](multimodal-model/docker/miccai2025_challenge_descriptor_neuropoly_multimodal.json), with usage instructions [here](multimodal-model/docker).

### Contribution to Open Science

This project contributes to open science by:

- Publishing the complete pipeline code and documentation on GitHub  
- Providing a Docker image to ensure reproducibility across environments  
- Creating a Boutiques descriptor to facilitate automated reuse by other researchers  
- Building on and extending open-source tools such as nnUNet and SCT  
- Enabling multimodal spinal cord lesion segmentation—an underexplored area in neuroimaging research  

### Conclusion

This project presents a complete pipeline for multimodal MS lesion segmentation in the spinal cord, from preprocessing to inference and postprocessing. It leverages state-of-the-art tools and open standards to enable reproducibility and accessibility. The pipeline successfully integrates multimodal imaging data and handles the complexity of spinal cord anatomy, providing reliable segmentation outputs.

### Next Steps

- Evaluate the model on additional test data and quantify performance per modality  
- Extend support to include missing modalities through imputation or modality-agnostic models  
- Release a demo dataset to allow users to test the pipeline without requiring private data  
- Submit the pipeline to MICCAI MS Challenge 2025 results and benchmark against other approaches

## Expertise
This site has particular expertise in fMRI processing, fMRI analysis, functional connectivity analysis, multivariate statistics, and neuroinformatics.

## Prerequisites
Participants will need access to a computer and internet, and to register to a number of online collaborative tools, such as Discord and GitHub. The installation of the necessary software will be covered during Week 1. Since we are starting later in the week, we **highly recommend attendees finish all the installation modules before our first on-site day**.

## Registration
The registration is closed.

## Schedule
The school will run hybrid over the 4-week run, where in-person recommended days at our host sites will be opened from 9 am to 5 pm, with a one-hour break for lunch. We will also add remote days where students can return to their responsibilities outside Brainhack School.

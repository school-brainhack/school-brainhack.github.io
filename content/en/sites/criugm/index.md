## Prerequisites
Participants will need access to a computer, internet and to register to a number of online collaborative tools, such as discord and github. The installation of the necessary software will be covered during week 1.

## Registration
Students based at UdeM and interested in the course need to register through "le centre étudiant" in addition to completing the registration form below.

If a student wants to register without credit, they can do so but still need to complete the registration form and register themselves as "auditeurs libres" through "le centre étudiant".

Students from other universities such as McGill and Concordia are also welcome to register. They can generally get the course credited in their program (as an optional course). For that they will first need to check that the course is eligible with their program, which may require to share the UdeM syllabus of the course (available by request to Pierre L Bellec). Then they will need to register to the course through the ["bureau de coopération inter-universitaire"](https://www.bci-qc.ca/).

## Dates
The course is conducted with the international BrainHack School. We combine self-paced module learning with tutorials and project-based practical work under Teaching Assistant (TA) advising over two phases during the semester: Preparation Phase (Mid-March to early May), International Phase (May to June).

## Location
We will use Discord as the main communication platform for posting announcements, raising questions, sharing resources, networking, and comments on tutorials and projects. For Singapore, we will primarily use the BrainHack.School.Singapore, Discord server before and after the Brainhack school. During the International Phase, we will shift primary engagement to the international Discord server (link provided later in course) to foster collaborative work.

## Schedule
Singapore students in the BrainHack School Singapore NTU (BHS-SG-NTU) hub will do self-paced module learning with primary advising by local TAs. We will join with the BHS international hub. Students submit weekly module tutorials to the local hub courses. In addition, students propose, work on, and submit progress reports on their own practical projects, working collaboratively with students and TAs from local or other hubs. The final week will be a mini-symposium for students to share their research findings. There will also be talks by faculty and other professionals as schedule permits.
